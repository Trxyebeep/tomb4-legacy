# TOMB4
Fork of [tomb4](https://github.com/Trxyebeep/TOMB4) for the purpose of preserving the original Tomb Raider 4 source code as is.
- All fixes and unoriginal code were removed
- Exceptions are: 
1) things that fail the compilation process, such as uninitialized vars.
2) the software renderer.
3) Bink stuff.

Everything else is original and should behave exactly as the retail TR4 executable.
